Version 1.00

This package is intended for use with a USB to I2C communications module, linked to
SRF08 sonar sensors.  It allows the user to broadcast the sonar ranges using a ROS publisher.

USB to I2C module details: http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/usb_i2c_tech.htm
Sonar sensor details:      http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/srf08tech.shtml

To compile the package.

1.  Make a directory called usbi2c within your ros/pkgs directory
2.  Copy these files into the usbi2c directory
3.  roscore
4.  rosmake --rosdep-install usbi2c

To set the address of a sonar sensor.

1.  Connect the sensor to the USB-I2C module.  Only a single sensor should be attached.
2.  roscore
3.  rosrun usbi2c sonar _device:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _sensors:=1 _address:=<address>
    Where the address is a hex value in the range 0xe0 to 0xfe

To broadcast sonar ranges.

1.  roscore
2.  rosrun usbi2c sonar _device:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _sensors:=<number of sensors>

The sensors should be assigned adjacent addresses so that the publisher can cycle through them.
Potentially other activation patterns could be devised, but at present each sensor is activated
sequentially.

With the publisher running there is also an example client program which can be run with:

    rosrun usbi2c sonar_client

This should connect to the publisher and receive sonar ranges.
